# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

REQUIREMENTS :

	- Nodejs
	- npm
	
How to run the Project?

	- Download the Project zip file and extract that in your system
	- move to project directory in a terminal
	- put the command "npm install" (it will takes few seconds)
	- Then run the command "npm run dev"
